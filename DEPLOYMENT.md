## ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Steps

### Method 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Insurance PDF Comparator"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Railway**:
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository
   - Railway will automatically detect the `Procfile` and deploy

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Check the deployment logs
   - Test the application URL
   - Upload a test PDF to verify functionality

### Method 2: Railway CLI

1. **Install Railway CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

## ðŸ”§ Post-Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables (Optional)
```
PORT=5000
```

### Custom Domain (Optional)
- Add custom domain in Railway dashboard
- Update DNS records as instructed

## ðŸ§ª Testing After Deployment

### Basic Functionality
1. **Homepage Load**: Verify the upload page loads correctly
2. **File Upload**: Test uploading a PDF file
3. **PDF Parsing**: Verify data extraction works
4. **Results Display**: Check comparison table renders
5. **PDF Export**: Test PDF generation and download

### Sample Test Files
Create test PDFs with content like:
```
HDI SEGUROS
Total a Pagar: $15,000.00
DaÃ±os Materiales
LÃ­mite de Responsabilidad: $500,000
Deducible: 5%
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard
- Monitor CPU and memory usage
- Check deployment logs
- Set up alerts for errors

### Application Logs
- PDF parsing errors
- WeasyPrint issues
- File upload problems

## ðŸ”„ Updates and Maintenance

### Code Updates
1. Make changes locally
2. Test with `python test_app.py`
3. Push to GitHub
4. Railway auto-deploys

### Dependency Updates
1. Update `requirements.txt`
2. Test locally
3. Deploy to Railway

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Deployment Fails**:
- Check `Procfile` syntax
- Verify all dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Check Railway logs

**PDF Parsing Errors**:
- Verify PDF contains extractable text
- Check company identification patterns
- Review parsing regex patterns

**WeasyPrint Issues**:
- Should work automatically on Railway
- Check Railway logs for specific errors
- Verify font availability
